# Huffman-Coding-algorithm

Huffman Coding Algorithm is widely used for data compression. It generates variable length prefix codes for every unique entity in the data.
I have implemented the HCA in python using the heapq data structure.

I also published a python library "akcompress" which can be used to compress text based data for now. I am working to include the feature to compress other forms of data as well.

To install the library into your local environment type "pip3 install akcompress" in the terminal.
